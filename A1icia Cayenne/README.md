# A1icia Cayenne

This is the Cayenne Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

Cayenne is the module that provides RDBMS services to A1icia. A1icia currently uses MySQL as the RDBMS engine. However, this module is implemented using [Apache Cayenne](https://cayenne.apache.org/) (hence the name), which means that A1icia can be built with any of the [following RDBMS products](http://cayenne.apache.org/database-support.html):

* DB2
* Derby
* FrontBase
* HSQLDB
* H2
* Ingres
* MySQL
* OpenBase
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite 3.*
* SQLServer
* Sybase

This is awesome, because it means that A1icia Central can run on very small to very large platforms with no discomfiture. Go A1icia.
