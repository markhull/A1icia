# Alixia November

This is the November Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

November handles user interaction with Alixia, such as logging in and out, security, and accessing private content. Private content just means data in the application that belongs to just one Alixian among all the users served by Alixia Central.

Alixia November is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
