# Alixia Prong

This is the Prong Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Prong is a small utility module that attempts to verify that communications between Alixia Central and her Stations is trustworthy. The reason it's a module by itself is that it normalized out that way based on where and how it is used.

Alixia Prong is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
