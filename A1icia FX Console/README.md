# A1icia FX Console

This is the FX Console Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

As you might guess, FX Console is a JavaFX implementation of a Command Line Interface (CLI) remote console. It communicates as a Station with A1icia Central. Besides acting as a terminal console, FX Console can play/display multimedia files.
