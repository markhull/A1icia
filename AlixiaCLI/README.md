# Alixia CLI

This is the CLI Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

CLI is a simple **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface module providing access to A1icia Central using a terminal. It is a little beefier than most CLIs in that it can also play multimedia files and display images and history text via Swing.

Alixia CLI is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
