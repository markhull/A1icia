# A1icia Tracker

This is the Tracker Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

Tracker monitors activity on A1icia's Hall bus. At one point this was very important in developing A1icia; now it isn't used for much because we decoupled requests and responses. But it's too cool to go away â€’ it uses GraphViz and Guava Graph stuff to model and record the bus activity.
