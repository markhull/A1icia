# Alixia Hotel

This is the Hotel Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Hotel is in charge of calendars, tasks and appointments. For instance, Hotel will provide reminders of upcoming appointments to logged-in Alixians. It also has small timers that can remind one when one's tea is ready, e.g. (Alixia can even do it with a British accent.)

Alixia Hotel is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
