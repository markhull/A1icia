# Alixia Bravo

This is the Bravo Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Bravo is the TensorFlow module. Currently, it "just" accepts a JPEG image and tries to classify it with the Inception Engine.

Alixia Bravo is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
