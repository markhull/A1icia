# A1icia API

This is the Application Programming Interface (API) for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

It should always be the case that this is the only essential module for communicating with A1icia Central. In other words, if 
you're going to create a remote Station for A1icia, you should only need this module (and its dependencies) to do so.
