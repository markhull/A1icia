# Alixia Kilo

This is the Kilo Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Kilo is the weather module. Currently we are using the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) service for weather data; we plan to evaluate Weather Underground as well in the near future.

Alixia Kilo is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
