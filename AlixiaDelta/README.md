# Alixia Delta

This is the Delta Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Delta provides Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) for Alixia. Additionally Delta handles hardware-related Station interaction, e.g. it knows how to LEDs on or off for a Station.

Alixia Delta is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
