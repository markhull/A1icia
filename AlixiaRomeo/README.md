# A1icia Romeo

This is the Romeo Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

Romeo is the games module. We are currently working on "Name That Tune", "Botticelli", and "Global Thermonuclear War". Kidding about the last one. Sweet Enola Gay, hasn't *anyone* seen ["War Games"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567)?
