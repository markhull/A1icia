# Alixia Node Server

This is the Node.js Server Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

The Node Server module implements a tiny web server in **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** for Alixia â€’ with Java! As written it isn't suitable for serving to the public at large but it certainly works for home or private LAN use. It utilizes the interesting [j2v8](https://github.com/eclipsesource/J2V8) library of Java bindings to the V8 J/S engine.

Alixia Node Server is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
