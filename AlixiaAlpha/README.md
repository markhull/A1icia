# Alixia Alpha

This is the Alpha Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Alpha is intended to be an exemplary module for A1icia. Alpha's only job is to respond with some form of the word 'aardvark' when queried.

Alixia Alpha is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
