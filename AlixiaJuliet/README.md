# Alixia Juliet

This is the Juliet Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Juliet is in charge of non-factoid queries. "Non-factoid" refers to the kinds of queries that don't have crisp factual answers that can be looked up. For example, "How many states are there?" is a factoid query; "What is your favorite state?" is a non-factoid query.

Alixia Juliet is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
