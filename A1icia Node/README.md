# A1icia Bravo

This is the Node Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

The Node module implements a tiny web server in **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** for A1icia â€’ with Java! As written it isn't suitable for serving to the public at large but it certainly works for home or private LAN use. It utilizes the interesting [j2v8](https://github.com/eclipsesource/J2V8) library of Java bindings to the V8 J/S engine.
