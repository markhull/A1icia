# A1icia Echo

This is the Echo Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

Echo implements [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec) in Java for A1icia. Word2Vec explores natural language word correlation. Echo implements the original Word2Vec, vs. e.g. TensorFlow Word2Vec. See also this author's [simpler-word2vec](https://github.com/markhull/simpler-word2vec) project.
