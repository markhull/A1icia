# Alixia Swing Console

This is the Swing Console Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Alixia Swing Console implements a CLI using Java Swing, which allows us to perform some fancier footwork than the plain old Java consoles allow in Alixia CLI. It is hoped that this will be foundation for a "smart console", that anticipates and assists user interaction.

Alixia Swing Console is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
