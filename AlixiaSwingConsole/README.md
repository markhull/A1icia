# A1icia Swing Console

This is the Swing Console Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

A1icia Swing Console implements a CLI using Java Swing, which allows us to perform some fancier footwork than the plain old Java consoles allow in Alicia CLI. It is hoped that this will be foundation for a "smart console", that anticipates and assists user interaction.
