# Alixia Papa

This is the Papa Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Papa handles interaction with [Wolfram\|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com). Alixia uses Wolfram\|Alpha along with other data providers to respond to user "factoid" queries. Who's your daddy? Papa's your daddy! (I tried really hard *not* to include those last two sentences but ultimately the sentences won.)

Alixia Papa is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
