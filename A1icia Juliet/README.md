# A1icia Juliet

This is the Juliet Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

Juliet is in charge of non-factoid queries. "Non-factoid" refers to the kinds of queries that don't have crisp factual answers that can be looked up. For example, "How many states are there?" is a factoid query; "What is your favorite state?" is a non-factoid query.
