# Alixia Tracker

This is the Tracker Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Tracker monitors activity on Alixia's Hall bus. At one point this was very important in developing Alixia; now it isn't used for much because we decoupled requests and responses. But it's too cool to go away â€’ it uses GraphViz and Guava Graph stuff to model and record the bus activity.

Alixia Tracker is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
