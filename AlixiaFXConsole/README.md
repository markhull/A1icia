# Alixia FX Console

This is the FX Console Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

As you might guess, FX Console is a JavaFX implementation of a Command Line Interface (CLI) remote console. It communicates as a Station with Alixia Central. Besides acting as a terminal console, FX Console can play/display multimedia files.

Alixia FX Console is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
