# A1icia Papa

This is the Papa Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

Papa handles interaction with [Wolfram\|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com). A1icia uses Wolfram\|Alpha along with other data providers to respond to user "factoid" queries. Who's your daddy? Papa's your daddy! (I tried really hard *not* to include those last two sentences but ultimately the sentences won.)
