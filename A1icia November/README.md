# A1icia November

This is the November Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

November handles user interaction with A1icia, such as logging in and out, security, and accessing private content. Private content just means data in the application that belongs to just one A1ician among all the users served by A1icia Central.
