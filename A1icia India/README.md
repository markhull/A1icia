# A1icia India

This is the India Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

India handles "directed random" text responses. "Directed random" just means that India provides random responses within a category, for example "prompts". It has some overlapping functionality with Oscar, and probably one of them will get merged with the other at some point soon.
