# A1icia Hotel

This is the Hotel Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

Hotel is in charge of calendars, tasks and appointments. For instance, Hotel will provide reminders of upcoming appointments to logged-in A1icians. It also has small timers that can remind one when one's tea is ready, e.g. (A1icia can even do it with a British accent.)
