Fortuna is really a stand-alone program, not an Alixia module. It is included here because Alixia uses it and I happened to have written it, so I can.

Fortuna is just a quote server â€’ it furnishes quotes to the calling program from a Cayenne MySQL database that I have compiled over the years.

Fortuna is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
