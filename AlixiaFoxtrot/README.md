# Alixia Foxtrot

This is the Foxtrot Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Foxtrot functions as a system monitor for Alixia, and is able to report on the state of the hardware upon which Alixia Central is running.

Alixia Foxtrot is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
