# Alixia India

This is the India Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

India handles "directed random" text responses. "Directed random" just means that India provides random responses within a category, for example "prompts". It has some overlapping functionality with Oscar, and probably one of them will get merged with the other at some point soon.

Alixia India is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
