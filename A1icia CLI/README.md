# A1icia CLI

This is the CLI Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

CLI is a simple Command Line Interface module providing access to A1icia Central using a terminal. It is a little beefier than most CLIs in that it can also play multimedia files and display images and history text via Swing.
