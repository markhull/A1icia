# Alixia Pi AIY

This is the Pi AIY Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Alixia knows about two kinds of Pi: 3.141592653589793... and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org). This module provides Alixia Central/Station communication to/from a Raspberry Pi, either with a Command Line Interface (CLI) or as a so-called Magic Mirror. It runs on the Pi and can control the hardware in Java, **not** Python, thanks to the [pi4j](https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j) library.

This version of Alixia Pi is for use with the Google AIY Voice hardware.

The source is Java 8; it will be updated to Java 10 when feasible.
