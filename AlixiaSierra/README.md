# Alixia Sierra

This is the Sierra Module for the [Alixia Project](https://github.com/markhull/Alixia).

Sierra interacts with IoT devices for Alixia. Currently it just queries a DHT11 sensor for (indoor) temperature and weather.

Alixia Sierra is now Java 10. See `module-info.java` for module path requirements.
