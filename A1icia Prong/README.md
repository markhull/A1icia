# A1icia Prong

This is the Prong Module for the [A1icia Project](https://github.com/markhull/A1icia).

Prong is a small utility module that attempts to verify that communications between A1icia Central and her Stations is trustworthy. The reason it's a module by itself is that it normalized out that way based on where and how it is used.
